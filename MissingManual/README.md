Xcode gradient objective-c sample code 

This project should help to understand the mac api.
Coming back to code for the mac after 6 years I catch only deprecations and some SW does not work at all even so I followed the recommended ways. Trying to read the documentation does not help, since neither deprecations are explained and work arrounds are given nor examples for the new api are given. It looks like that latest available official sample code is dated from 2014-2016. 

Currently the projects are written in Objective-C, but the latest Swift versions are also welcome.

The first program is a gradient test sample code allowing to define a 2 step gradient and to retrieve the corresponding sample code. 

This SW displays a 2 point linear or radial gradient that can be manipulated by the mouse and entry of some parameters. The final code can be retrieved by the edit menu item: CopyGradientCode
